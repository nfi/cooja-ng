/*
 * sim_mote_t — the kernel-facing mote object (Phase 2 of the refactor,
 * docs/design/refactor-plan.md §3.16 / §4.3).
 *
 * A mote is an opaque `impl` pointer plus a vtable.  The runner's four
 * node kinds (MSP430 emulated, ARM emulated, native Cooja, JS app)
 * each provide one `sim_mote_ops_t` table; everything that previously
 * switched on `node_type_t` dispatches through the table instead.
 *
 * Phase 4 (§3.17): the native/JS adapter tables and all boot policy
 * live in src/motes/; the MSP430/ARM execute/serial adapters stay in
 * the runner (test/test_mixed_multinode.c) because they reference
 * runner-side policy state (ticking guard, GDB stubs, RX queue
 * drains) — they follow those dependencies in Phase 5/6.
 *
 * Ops are added milestone by milestone (M11..M17); members below are
 * grouped by the milestone that introduced them.  All ops are
 * mandatory for every mote kind unless the comment says optional —
 * keeps call sites free of NULL checks for the common paths.
