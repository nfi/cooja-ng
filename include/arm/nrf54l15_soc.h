/*
 * nRF54L15 SoC peripheral bundle — first cut.
 *
 * Models the bare minimum to clear the Reset_Handler boot path. Right
 * now that's exactly one peripheral:
 *
 *   - GLOBAL_CLOCK at 0x5010_E000 (offsets discovered empirically with
 *     hello-world.nrf54l15-dk — see devices/nrf54l15-dk/STATUS.md).
 *     Handles the HFXO start handshake: firmware writes 1 to
 *     TASKS_HFXOSTART (offset 0), then spins reading
 *     EVENTS_HFXOSTARTED (offset 0x100) until non-zero. We latch the
 *     event immediately so nrfx_clock_start exits.
 *
 * Everything else (GRTC, UARTE20, GPIO/GPIOTE, RADIO, DPPI, …) lands
 * in subsequent commits, driven by what firmware actually traps on.
 *
 * Plugs into `arm_platform_t` through the `arm_soc_ops_t` vtable in
 * `arm_platform.h`. Note: the address range is 0x5xxx_xxxx, NOT
 * 0x4xxx_xxxx as on nRF52 — different peripheral region entirely.
