# CLAUDE.md — Cooja-NG C Emulator

## Design Documents

Before kernel, platform, plugin, or simulation-runner refactors, read
[`docs/design/refactor-plan.md`](docs/design/refactor-plan.md). It defines the
internal simulation kernel direction, static plugin registry model, and staged
runtime extraction plan.

## Build

```sh
make              # O3, LTO, auto-detects GNU Lightning for JIT
make debug        # O0, -g, DEBUG flag
make pgo          # Profile-guided optimization. Recursive make, so it reuses the
                  # normal per-object rules (it can't drift out of sync with CFLAGS
                  # again). Trains on MSP430 *and* ARM workloads — it was MSP430-only
                  # before, so every ARM hot path was laid out blind. Works with
                  # clang (llvm-profdata) and gcc (-fprofile-generate/use); override
                  # the merge tool with `make pgo PROFDATA=/path/to/llvm-profdata`.
                  # Measured on an *untrained* workload (chain-3node-nrf52840-dk):
                  # ~1.55x on clang/arm64, ~1.18x on gcc/x86-64. arm-bench itself is
                  # in the training set, so its 1.6-2.0x is an optimistic read.
make clean        # Remove build/
```

GNU Lightning is optional (auto-detected via pkg-config). Without it, the interpreter is used for all execution.

## Testing

```sh

                                         # is a SECOND implementation of Thumb-16 semantics,
                                         # and flag-only drift between two implementations
                                         # is invisible until a branch flips (exactly the

Multinode options: `-t ms` (sim duration), `-n nodes` (node count), `-q` (quiet), `-v` (verbose).

`CSIM_PHASE_TIMING=1` adds a wall-time breakdown at the end of a run — how much
went into the event pump (CPU step + event dispatch) versus the runner
scaffolding around it. Off by default because the clock reads it needs profiled
at 7% of self time on an ARM workload. Useful for answering "is this workload
interpreter-bound?" without a profiler: single-node `zephyr-synchronization` is
95.3% pump / 4.7% other, `chain-3node-nrf52840-dk` 96.5% / 3.5%.

# Renode co-simulation — csim as clock SLAVE (docs/design/renode-cosim-plan.md).
# Renode drives csim's horizon with its own fixed-quantum tickClock protocol,
# and csim's whole 802.15.4 network appears in Renode as one memory-mapped
# device.  No Renode-side code: one CoSimulated.CoSimulatedPeripheral line in
# a .repl (examples/renode/csim-host.repl).  A ".renode" firmware entry selects
# the device node the way ".py" selects an external node; the path is never
# opened.  Verified against Renode 1.17 (a real RPL-UDP run: examples/renode).
#
# Renode STARTS csim (setting simulationFilePath is what opens the sockets and
# launches the peer), so the scenario is passed through the environment:
export CSIM_CONFIG=$PWD/configs/test-renode-rpl-sky.yaml
export CSIM_RENODE_FREQ_HZ=1000000     # must match `frequency` in the .repl

renode examples/renode/csim-rpl.resc    # then `start` in Renode's monitor
#
# CSIM_RENODE_TRACE=1 prints one line per protocol step with wall-clock times —
# the symptom of a protocol mistake is both sides waiting and neither saying why.
tools/check-renode-cosim.sh                     # end-to-end vs the Python mock master:
                                                # exact clock coupling, frames both ways,

    --spawn './build/test_runner test configs/test-renode-sky.yaml --renode {2}:{0}:{1} --renode-freq 1000000 -q'
```

The runner's loop does not name Renode: an external clock source installs
itself on the kernel as a `sim_clock_source_t` (one function returning the
next horizon, or -1 when the run is over) and the loop asks that instead of
computing a horizon itself.  Renode's service is one implementation; a
JSON co-simulation coordinator would be another and would add no lines to
existing core files.

The two protocols **compose**: running both at once makes csim a clock slave
to Renode and a clock master to esp32sim at the same time, while it owns the
medium for all of them (`configs/test-threeway-cosim.yaml`, §12 of the plan).
Three emulators, three ISAs (ARM Cortex-M3 / MSP430 16-bit / RISC-V 32-bit),
carrying the standard stack — IPv6 / 6LoWPAN / RPL / UDP — with
csim's MSP430 and esp32sim's RISC-V completing UDP round trips through an RPL
DAG while Renode drives the clock. Deterministic end to end. esp32sim is an
out-of-tree binary, so like the real-Renode runs this is a documented harness
rather than a CI gate.

Renode's own CC2538 can be the **RPL root** of a csim network
(`configs/test-renode-root-rpl.yaml`, `-2clients.yaml`): csim's Sky and
nRF52840 clients join its DAG and complete UDP round trips through it, with
`examples/renode/bridge/CsimBridge.cs` joining Renode's medium to csim's. The
bridge supplies what Renode's frame-level radio lacks -- air time on the way
in, and the 192 µs ACK turnaround on the way back (§11). The reverse, Renode
as a *client* of a csim root, does not yet complete RPL.

NB the co-simulation protocols run in opposite directions and are deliberately
different. `.renode` = **Renode owns the clock**, binary, bus-shaped. `.py` =
**csim owns the clock**, NDJSON, node-shaped, exact-time stepping with
ns-stamped frames (`docs/design/external-nodes-plan.md`, and §14.5 there for
why esp32sim keeps it).

### Simulation Kernel (src/sim/)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `sim_runtime.c` | `sim_runtime_t` container: now_ns, unified event queue, radio medium, mote slots + generations, observer fan-out, `sim_runtime_run_until()` event pump |
| `sim_radio_bus.c` | Full RF delivery path (Phase 5): per-sender byte clock, frame assembler (802.15.4 + 802.15.4g), medium-filtered per-receiver dispatch (SYNC/PER_BYTE/BATCH), RX-stall timer, emulated RX core (deliver/queue/drain), frame-complete policy (air-time + collision windows, RXFIFO backpressure, dual 192 µs auto-ACK windows), native/JS frame path, channel push/pull, channel-busy query, bus-owned RX/frame stats |
| `sim_board.c` | Board registry: firmware extension → {mote kind, platform name, label} |
| `sim_registry.c` | Static built-in registry (Phase 8): one `sim_registry_t` lookup surface for boards, mote kinds, services, and radio media; `csim_register_builtin_{platforms,mote_types,services,media}` populate it; services + media (Phase 11: "udgm"/"none" + plugins) resolve by name via owned name→ops catalogs |
| `sim_plugin.c` | Dynamic plugin loader (Phase 9): `sim_plugin_load` dlopens a `.so` (RTLD_NOW\|RTLD_LOCAL), resolves `csim_plugin_init`, and hands it a `csim_api_t` so the plugin registers a service. ABI is additive/version-gated (`include/sim/csim_plugin.h`): v1 `register_service`, v2 `+register_radio_medium`, v3 `+ui->publish_panel` (a plugin draws a live web-UI panel — see [`docs/design/ui-plugins.md`](docs/design/ui-plugins.md)). Dynamic `.so` examples: `plugins/packet_sink.c` (service), `plugins/lossy_medium.c` (medium). A plugin can also be **compiled in** as a built-in service (registered in `sim_registry.c`) and selected by config name (`"plugins": ["energest"]`, Cooja's built-in-plugin style) — example: the energy estimator `src/services/energest_{engine,service}.c` |
| `sim_config.c` | Config loader (Phase 7): `sim_config_load` picks the front end by extension (`.yaml`/`.yml` → libyaml, `.json` → cJSON), runs the schema validator, then dispatches on `version` to `parse_v1`/`parse_v2`, both populating one `sim_normalized_config_t` the runtime consumes |
| `sim_config_yaml.c` | YAML front end (strict YAML-1.2-core subset: no anchors/tags/multi-doc, YAML-1.1 booleans rejected), the table-driven schema validator both formats share (unknown/duplicate keys and wrong types are errors), and the canonical v2 YAML **writer** (`--save-config`, `config-convert`). libyaml's parser half is vendored in `lib/yaml/` (see its README) |
| `sim_service.c` | Service host (Phase 6 M31): `sim_service_ops_t` vtable table + one fan-out observer + ordered poll/teardown + error policy |
| `sim_serial_bridge.c` | TCP serial socket service (Cooja serial-socket protocol) |
| `sim_external_command.c` | External command service (border-router etc. helper processes) |

### Services (src/services/)

Phase 6 extracted the runner's optional/observation features into services
behind the `sim_service_ops_t` host: `timeline_service.c` (activity
timeline), `pcap_service.c` (802.15.4 capture), `progress_service.c`
(per-tick progress report), `json_test_service.c` (JSON step/validator
runner), `js_test_service.c` (JS test-engine line feed), `gdb_service.c`
(per-mote GDB stub; sets `cpu->gdb_stub`), `websocket_ui_service.c` (live
UI: ws_server + console + serialization), and `renode_cosim_service.c`
(Renode co-simulation: the only service that *supplies* the runner's horizon
instead of observing it — see `docs/design/renode-cosim-plan.md`). The end-of-run statistics stay
runner-side (type-specific diagnostics that read chip memory + firmware
symbols).

A later addition is the energy estimator, shipped as a **compiled-in plugin**:
`energest_engine.c` (host-agnostic core — per-mote radio duty cycle + Energest
CPU/LPM/TX/LISTEN energy from the `SIM_OBS_RADIO_STATE`/`SIM_OBS_CPU_STATE`
observer stream, driven by a `publish`+`log` sink) and `energest_service.c`
(the built-in wrapper, registered in `sim_registry.c`, selectable by config
name `"plugins": ["energest"]`). It also publishes a live web-UI panel via the
v3 plugin ABI. See [`docs/design/ui-plugins.md`](docs/design/ui-plugins.md).

### Mote Modules (src/motes/)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `mote_impl.h` | Private shared header: `mixed_node_t`, `sim_mote_env_t` (runner glue bundle), per-kind module APIs |
| `mote_kinds.c` | Mote-kind registry: board kind → {boot, register_radio, ops} row |
| `msp430_elf_mote.c` | MSP430 boot policy (ELF load, ds2411/infomem/node-id patches, run-to-main), execute tick, CC2420 radio ops, full mote vtable (`msp430_elf_mote_ops`) |
| `arm_elf_mote.c` | ARM boot policy (cc2538/firefly/nrf52840/nrf54l15 wiring, FICR seeding, linkaddr patches), execute tick, radio ops, full mote vtable (`arm_elf_mote_ops`) |
| `native_cooja_mote.c` | Native Cooja mote: boot, full adapter table, tick helpers, SYNC radio ops |
| `js_app_mote.c` | JS app mote: boot, full adapter table, BATCH radio ops |
| `renode_mote.c` | Renode co-simulation device: a passive node with no CPU and no clock of its own, driven entirely by bus accesses from Renode. Gives the device its place in the medium (position, channel, RSSI) and the frame in/out path; the register window itself is `src/native/renode_dev.c` |

The mote vtable (`include/sim/sim_mote.h`, `sim_mote_ops_t`) abstracts the four
node kinds (MSP430/ARM/native/JS). All four kinds' ops tables are module-owned
now — Phase 6 M38 moved the MSP430/ARM execute/serial adapters into their
modules (the radio-bus dependency cleared in Phase 5, the GDB-stub dependency
in Phase 6 M37), retiring the runner-side injection. See
`docs/design/refactor-plan.md` §3.15–§3.23 for the completed Phase 1–10
milestones (Phase 5 extracted the RF-delivery policy into `sim_radio_bus.c`
and retired `--threads`; Phase 6 extracted the observation/optional features
into `src/services/` behind a `sim_service_ops_t` host and moved the emulated
adapters out; Phase 7 added config v2 over one `sim_normalized_config_t`;
Phase 8 routed the runner's board/mote-kind/service lookups through one
static `sim_registry_t`; Phase 10 shrank the runner to a pure frontend —
the emulated MSP430/ARM chip coupling moved behind mote ops
(`dump_diagnostics`/`apply_startup_delay`/`program_counter`) so the runner
includes no chip headers and never switches on `NODE_MSP430`/`NODE_ARM`;
Phase 9 added the dlopen plugin ABI (`csim_plugin.h` + `sim_plugin.c`, v1 =
register a service; example `plugins/packet_sink.c`). The native host-process
scheduling policy is the one documented deferral. **The staged refactor
(Phases 1–10) is complete.**

### ARM Source Files (src/arm/)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `arm_cpu.c` | Core Cortex-M3 CPU: Thumb/Thumb-2 interpreter, IT blocks, exception handling, step/step_until, JIT dispatcher + lockstep verifier. On ARMv8-M also the **TrustZone-M** security state: banked SP/CONTROL, SG/BXNS/BLXNS/FNC_RETURN, TT/TTT/TTA/TTAT, secure exception entry/return with the integrity signature, and per-node transition counters. The JIT never runs Non-secure code — `arm_tz_blocks()` lives in the interpreter's memory path, so the dispatcher hands NS execution back |
| `arm_trustzone.c` | **TrustZone-M attribution engine** (ARMv8-M security extension): SAU regions combined with a per-SoC attribution hook (the nRF54L15 security unit), `arm_security_attr()`, memory-mapped SAU registers at `0xE000EDD0` (Secure-only, RAZ/WI from Non-secure), and `arm_tz_blocks()` hot-path access enforcement feeding SecureFault/SFSR. Non-secure instruction fetch is refused from Secure memory and, in the callable window, for anything but `SG` (SecureFault INVEP); the lookup is cached per window over which attribution cannot change (the page clamped to the SAU region boundaries). Gated per MCU by `has_trustzone` (nRF54L15 only) |
| `arm_decode.c` | Stateless Thumb-16 decoder for the JIT-compilable subset -> `arm_decoded_insn_t`, basic-block decoder. Deliberately a *second* implementation of the semantics, differential-tested by `arm-decode` |

| `nrf54l15_soc.c` | nRF54L15 SoC bundle: GRTC/DPPI/RADIO/EGU/TIMER/UARTE/FICR, **GPIO P0-P2**, and the **VPR/SPU FLPR-launch registers** (CPURUN/INITPC + SECATTR gate) |

### RISC-V Source Files (src/riscv/)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `riscv_cpu.c` | RV32EMC interpreter (`rv32emc_zicsr_zifencei`): base RV32I + M (mul/div/rem) + C (compressed) + CSR + `fence.i` + M-mode traps. Shares the host M33's memory/IO bus, so SRAM + peripherals are one address space. No F/D |
| `nrf54l_vpr.c` | Bridge: on the M33's VPR `CPURUN` edge, instantiate the FLPR over the shared bus and co-step it after each ARM execute slice (SoC-agnostic `coproc` hook on `arm_cpu_t`) |

## Architecture

### CPU Execution Engine

Computed-goto dispatch with flat memory array and per-address IO callbacks.

**Hot path** (no overhead from ns timing):
1. Fetch instruction at PC
2. Dispatch via computed goto (or JIT compiled block if hot)
3. Execute, update registers/flags/cycles
4. Check `cycles >= next_event_cycle` -> fire events if needed
5. Check pending interrupts if GIE=1

**Execution modes:**
- `msp430_step(cpu, n)` — Step n instructions
- `msp430_step_until(cpu, target_cycle)` — Run until cycle target reached

### Nanosecond Simulation Time

Dual-time architecture: CPU cycles (hot path) + nanosecond wall-clock time (for peripherals).

**Key fields in `msp430_cpu_t`:**
- `int64_t sim_time_ns` — current simulation time in nanoseconds
- `uint32_t cpu_freq_hz` — current CPU frequency (set by clock module)

**Event scheduling:**
- `msp430_schedule_event(cpu, ev, cycle)` — fire at specific CPU cycle (fire_ns=0)
- `msp430_schedule_event_ns(cpu, ev, ns)` — fire at wall-clock ns time (shadow fire_cycle computed)
- `msp430_cancel_event(cpu, ev)` — remove from queue

**Frequency changes** (`msp430_cpu_set_frequency()`):
- Called from `recalculate_dco()` when firmware writes DCOCTL/BCSCTL1/BCSCTL2
- Syncs `sim_time_ns` from cycles using OLD frequency
- Recomputes `fire_cycle` for all ns-based events using NEW frequency
- Re-sorts the event queue

**Conversion helpers** (inline):
```c
msp430_ns_to_cycles(ns, freq_hz)     // ns -> cycles
msp430_cycles_to_ns(cycles, freq_hz) // cycles -> ns
```

**sim_time_ns sync points:**
- `execute_events()` — before firing each event callback
- `msp430_step_until()` — at end, after reaching target cycle
- `msp430_cpu_set_frequency()` — before changing frequency

### JIT Compiler (GNU Lightning)

Compiles hot basic blocks to native code. Auto-detected via pkg-config.

**What gets JIT-compiled:**
- Two-operand ALU: ADD, ADDC, SUB, CMP, AND, OR, XOR, BIT, BIC, BIS, MOV (reg/CG/imm -> reg only)
- All 8 jump conditions: JNE, JEQ, JNC, JC, JN, JGE, JL, JMP
- Only blocks where ALL instructions are inlineable (no mixed inline/fallback)

**NOT compiled:** SUBC, DADD, memory-addressed operands, SR/PC writes, PUSH/CALL/RETI

**Configuration:**
- `MSPSIM_JIT_THRESHOLD` env var (default 100): executions before compiling
- `MSPSIM_JIT_INBLOCK_CHECKS` env var (default 0): interrupt checks inside JIT blocks
- `block_exec_count[pc>>1]` tracks execution count per block
- Cache invalidation on memory writes (clears compiled_cache + block_exec_count)

**Register allocation:**
- JIT_V0 = cpu pointer, JIT_V1 = reg[] base, JIT_V2 = cycles accumulator
- JIT_R0/R1/R2 = temporaries

### CC2420 Radio

Full state machine matching Java MSPSim's CC2420.java.

**Radio states:** VREG_OFF -> POWER_DOWN -> IDLE -> RX_CALIBRATE -> RX_SFD_SEARCH -> RX_FRAME (and TX chain)

**Timing (ns-based, CPU-clock independent):**
- Symbol period: 16,000 ns (62.5 ksym/s)
- Byte period: 32,000 ns (2 symbols/byte)
- Oscillator startup: 1,000,000 ns (1 ms)
- RX calibration: 12 symbols (192,000 ns)
- TX calibration: 12 symbols

**SPI protocol:** First byte determines operation (strobe, register read/write, RAM access, RXFIFO read, TXFIFO write). Status byte returned on every exchange.

**RX incoming buffer:** Bytes arriving during RX_CALIBRATE or RX_WAIT (post-TX turnaround) are buffered in `rx_incoming[256]` and batch-delivered when transitioning to RX_SFD_SEARCH.

**Auto-ACK:** If enabled (MDMCTRL0.AUTOACK) and frame has ACK_REQUEST bit and passes CRC + address filter, sends 5-byte ACK frame automatically.

**TX power (Phase 12):** a TXCTRL write pushes PA_LEVEL (`& 0x1f`, max 31) to the radio medium via the `radio_set_power` host hook; the medium scales effective range by `indicator/max` (Cooja UDGM). Firmware that holds max PA is byte-identical with the old fixed range.

**CRC:** CCITT-16 with bit reversal, matching CC2420 hardware behavior.

### Timer A/B

On-demand counter: not incremented every cycle. Instead, counter value is computed from elapsed cycles when read.

**Clock sources:** TCLK (external), ACLK (32768 Hz), SMCLK (DCO-derived), INCLK
**Modes:** Stop, Up (count to CCR0), Continuous (count to 0xFFFF), Up/Down
**Events:** CCR compare events scheduled in CPU event queue (cycle-based)

### Clock Module

Two variants selected by `mcu->clock_type`:

**BCS (classic, F1xx/F2xx; UCS on F5xxx is register-compatible)** — DCO frequency formula matches Java MSPSim:
```
dco_factor = (max_dco_freq - 1000) / 2048
freq = ((dco_freq << 5) + dco_mod + (rsel << 8)) * dco_factor + 1000
```
Default: DCOCTL=0x60, BCSCTL1=0x84 -> ~2.69 MHz (F1611). After firmware calibration: ~3.9 MHz.

**CS (FR5xxx)** — Password-protected (CSCTL0_H = 0xA5 unlocks). DCO frequency from a lookup table indexed by DCOFSEL/DCORSEL. Per-clock source select (SELA/SELS/SELM) and dividers (DIVA/DIVS/DIVM) in CSCTL2/CSCTL3.

ACLK is fixed at 32,768 Hz (crystal). SMCLK = DCO / divider.

## Multi-Node Simulation

Single-threaded, event-driven kernel (Cooja's scheduling model; Phases 1–3 of
`docs/design/refactor-plan.md`).  `sim_runtime_t` owns the simulation clock,
the unified `(time_ns, seq)`-ordered event queue, the radio medium/bus, and
the per-slot mote objects.

**Architecture:**
1. Initialize nodes: the board registry (`sim_board.c`) maps the firmware
   extension to a platform; load ELF, patch ds2411/node-id/linkaddr, run crt0
   to main, register mote + radio-endpoint ops
2. Kernel pump: `sim_runtime_run_until(sim, horizon, dispatch)` pops events in
   `(time, seq)` order, advancing `now_ns` to each event's exact time —
   `NODE_WAKEUP` (mote execute slice), `RX_BYTE` (per-byte radio delivery),
   `RADIO_TIMER` (RX-stall watchdog), `TEST_ACTION` (script time pins)
3. Mote execute: `ops->execute(m, now_ns)` runs one Cooja-style slice
   (MspMote.execute equivalent: clock-deviation jump, pinned sim_time,
   step_micros) and returns the mote's next wakeup time
4. RF TX: chip TX callbacks feed `sim_radio_bus_tx_byte()` (per-sender byte
   clock + frame assembler + medium filter), which dispatches per receiver
   delivery mode: SYNC (native), PER_BYTE (CC2420 / cc2538 / nrf52840 /
   nrf54l15 — one kernel RX_BYTE event per on-air byte; what makes TSCH's
   receiving_packet()-based slot timing work), BATCH (JS)

Per-mote cycle accounting inside the execute slices handles nodes running at
different CPU frequencies after DCO calibration.

### ARM Multi-Node (CC2538)

Same event-driven kernel as MSP430, with CC2538 RF Core for 802.15.4 radio:

1. Initialize nodes: load ELF, run crt0 to main, patch `linkaddr_node_addr` per node
2. Each node gets unique IEEE address (00:12:74:node_id:00:00:00:node_id)
3. RF Core TX callback feeds the radio bus; receivers take per-byte kernel events
4. Auto-ACK at link layer, CSMA retransmissions, 6LoWPAN/RPL networking all functional

**Supported firmware:**
- `nullnet-broadcast.cc2538dk` — simple broadcast, 2-node
- `udp-server.cc2538dk` + `udp-client.cc2538dk` — RPL-UDP with DAG formation

## MSP430 Instruction Encoding Notes

- Double-op format: `opcode(4)|src_reg(4)|Ad(1)|BW(1)|As(2)|dst_reg(4)`
- CG1 (R2): As=10->4, As=11->8. CG2 (R3): As=00->0, As=01->1, As=10->2, As=11->0xFFFF
- @Rn+ (autoincrement) = As=11, NOT As=01 (which is indexed)
- JMP offset: raw 10-bit value * 2 added to PC
- Reset interrupt adds 6 cycles

## Performance (Apple Silicon, PGO build)

| Benchmark | MIPS |
|-----------|------|
| Micro-benchmarks (avg) | ~430 |
| Firmware blink.sky | ~194 |
| Firmware energest-demo.sky | ~196 |
| 2-node nullnet (20s sim) | ~800x real-time |
| 2-node RPL-UDP (60s sim) | ~2400x real-time |

### ARM

| Benchmark | Speed |
|-----------|-------|
| CC2538 2-node RPL-UDP (60s sim) | ~300x real-time |

| nRF52840 2-node TSCH (60s sim) | ~14x real-time |

The ARM JIT (`src/arm/arm_jit.c`, GNU Lightning) compiles hot Thumb-16 basic
blocks — ALU, shifts, branches and guarded SRAM loads/stores — and is **on by
default when Lightning is present**. It is cycle-exact: `CSIM_ARM_JIT=0` and
`=1` produce byte-identical output, which is required because determinism is a
gated guarantee and Lightning is an optional dependency.

| Workload | JIT off | JIT on | |
|---|---|---|---|
| `zephyr-synchronization`, 1 node, 60 s sim | 2.05 s | **0.60 s** | **3.42x** |
| Contiki-NG ARM firmware (chain-3/4node, cc2538 RPL-UDP) | | | ~1.00x |

The split is coverage, not codegen: Zephyr images are Thumb-16 dense (average
compiled block 34.9 instructions), Contiki-NG ARM images are Thumb-2 dense
(1.7–2.4), and Thumb-2 is not compiled yet. See
[`docs/design/arm-performance-plan.md`](docs/design/arm-performance-plan.md) §5.
