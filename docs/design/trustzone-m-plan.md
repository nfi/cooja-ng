# TrustZone-M on csim: ARMv8-M security extension for the Cortex-M33 (nRF54L15)

**Status: COMPLETE (emulator track), extended 2026-09-03 — see *Steps 9–10*.**
Plan written 2026-07-18, implemented through 2026-07-26, re-verified
2026-07-30 on branch `trustzone`; Step 9 runs the split image under the
simulation kernel and validates it against hardware. Per-step
record under *Confirmed execution steps*; current measured numbers under
*Verified result*. The remaining work is the hardware track (DK golden-vector
capture) and deeper firmware exercise — both outside the core emulator.

**Goal:** implement the ARMv8-M security extension (TrustZone-M) in csim's
Cortex-M33 emulation so that csim runs *real* secure/non-secure partitioned
Contiki-NG firmware on the emulated nRF54L15, and counts+timestamps **every**
world transition (SG entry, BXNS/BLXNS, secure exception) per node,
network-wide.

**Achieved.** The M33 is no longer non-secure-only: `nrf54l15_config` sets
`has_trustzone = true`, the security extension lives in
`src/arm/arm_trustzone.c` (attribution engine) plus the state/transition work in
`src/arm/arm_cpu.c` and `src/arm/arm_nvic.c`, and csim boots the real
Contiki-NG `trustzone/` split image with per-node transition counters.

This is the enabler for the SenSys "IsoPartition" study (TEE-partitioning cost
in 6TiSCH): the P0–P3 partition schemes only become measurable once the cut
between secure and non-secure worlds is real and its per-transition cost is
modelled. It also makes csim, to our knowledge, the first *networked,
deterministic, cross-level* TrustZone-M emulation environment.

## Scope: paper-complete, not spec-complete

Build the subset the real Contiki-NG TZ firmware actually exercises, validate
it hard, ship it. Everything outside that is deferred to a "v2 / future work"
list at the end — **do not** implement the whole ARMv8-M security spec.

- **In scope (MVP):** SAU + SPU-as-IDAU attribution, secure/non-secure state,
  banked SP/CONTROL/xPSR-relevant state, SG/BXNS/BLXNS/TT, secure exception
  entry/return with additional-state stacking + integrity signature, lazy FP
  context (LSPACT), SecureFault, NVIC target-security banking, and the
  transition instrumentation.
- **Out of scope (defer):** full fault-escalation matrix corner cases, secure
  debug (SecureDebug/DAUTH), MPU_S/MPU_NS dual banking beyond what firmware
  programs, stack-limit fault variants firmware never triggers, and full TF-M
  (start with a hand-built minimal secure veneer).

The conformance target is concrete: **the firmware tells us what to support.**
`arch/cpu/nrf/nrf54l15/tz-target-cfg.c` and `tz-spu.c` in
`~/work/contiki-ng-nrf54l15` (branch `trustzone-port-v2`) program exactly the
SAU/SPU regions and veneers csim must honour.

## What csim already has (the foundation)

The core is well-shaped for this — the hooks have clean homes:

| Capability | Where | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Single memory-access chokepoint | `arm_read32/16/8`, `mem_read32` (`arm_cpu.c` ~L81/117/257) | SAU/IDAU attribution hooks here, one place |
| SP banking (MSP/PSP) + `use_psp`/CONTROL | `arm_cpu.c` ~L478–525, MSR/MRS ~L2454–2515 | extend to secure/NS banks |
| Exception entry/return + EXC_RETURN decode | `arm_exception_entry` (~L493), `exception_return` (~L555) | extend with S/NS, FType, DCRS, integrity sig |
| NVIC | `arm_nvic.c` | add target-security (`NVIC_ITNS`) + banked priority |
| SPU SECATTR (partial) | `nrf54l15_soc.c` ~L2096/2131 | already latches SECATTR for the FLPR; generalise to the CPU path |
| Secure address aliases known | `nrf54l15_soc.c` (0x5xxx secure / 0x4xxx NS windows) | memory-map foundation present |

**Absent today (new work):** SG/BXNS/BLXNS/TT decode (grep is empty), the
security-state machine, SAU registers, secure exception banking.

## State + register model additions (Phase 0)

Add to `arm_cpu_t`:

- `bool secure;` — current security state.
- Second SP bank: `msp_s/msp_ns`, `psp_s/psp_ns` (the existing `msp/psp`
  become the *active-state* bank; refactor all accesses through a
  current-bank accessor first, keeping the MSP/PSP tests green).
- `msplim_s/msplim_ns`, `psplim_s/psplim_ns` (MSPLIM/PSPLIM).
- `control_s/control_ns` (SPSEL/nPRIV/FPCA/SFPA).
- Secure system regs: `VTOR_S`, `AIRCR.BFHFNMINS/PRIS`, `SHCSR_S`,
  `CCR_S`, and the banked SysTick.
- Banked special-register MSR/MRS: `MSP_NS/PSP_NS/MSPLIM_NS/...`,
  `CONTROL_NS`, `SP_NS` (`arm_cpu.c` MSR/MRS block).

This refactor is load-bearing; do it first, in isolation, with existing
register tests still passing.

## Memory attribution: SAU + SPU-as-IDAU (Phase 1)

In the `mem_read*/write*` chokepoint, add `attr = sau_idau_lookup(addr, secure)`
→ `{NS, NSC, Secure}` with the **conservative rule** (secure if *either* SAU or
IDAU says secure):

- **SAU registers**: `SAU_CTRL/TYPE/RNR/RBAR/RLAR` (0/4/8 regions;
  base/limit at bits 5–31, NSC flag in RLAR).
- **IDAU = the Nordic SPU**: extend the existing FLPR SECATTR mechanism
  (`nrf54l15_soc.c`) to attribute the full address space per the SPU
  `PERIPH[]/FLASHREGION[]/RAMREGION[]` config that `tz-spu.c` programs.
- **Fault**: NS access to S memory → SecureFault (or RAZ/WI per config).

Correctness here is subtle — build against the ARMv8-M attribution table, and
validate region-by-region against what `tz-target-cfg.c` actually sets.

## Transition instruction surface (Phase 2)

New Thumb decode in `arm_cpu.c`:

- **SG** — legal only when executed from an NSC region; flips NS→S at a veneer
  entry. SG from non-NSC → SecureFault (INVEP).
- **BXNS / BLXNS** — S→NS return/call; BLXNS pushes the special return frame
  and sets the FNC/integrity state.
- **TT / TTT / TTA / TTAT** — query attribution (used by TF-M and veneers).

## Secure exception model (Phase 3)

Extend `arm_exception_entry` / `exception_return`:

- Select stack bank by **target** security state.
- On S→NS entry: additional-state stacking + **integrity signature**
  (0xFEFA125A/B) in the frame; on return, validate it.
- Extend EXC_RETURN with `ES` (bit 0, S/NS), `SPSEL`, `DCRS` (bit 5),
  `FType` (bit 4). New valid patterns (e.g. 0xFFFFFFBC) — cf. the known
  Renode gap, issue #937.
- **Lazy FP context** (`LSPACT`, `FPCCR_S/NS`) — model it, don't stub it: it
  is a large, load-dependent chunk of the exception-latency cost the paper
  measures.
- Add SecureFault (SHCSR_S.SECUREFAULTENA) + escalation to secure HardFault.

## NVIC + SysTick banking (Phase 4)

`arm_nvic.c`: per-interrupt target-security bit (`NVIC_ITNS[]`), banked
priorities, `AIRCR.PRIS` (NS priority range restriction), and a banked
SysTick. This is what makes the **ISR-path** transition latency (hypothesis
H3, the "cliff") real.

## The instrumentation payoff (Phase 5)

Once Phases 0–4 are real, add per-node counters + ns-timestamps at each
transition point (SG, BXNS/BLXNS, secure exception entry/exit, with a
`+FPctx` flag). Expose to the campaign harness (`test_runner` log lines, e.g.
`TZ SG=... BXNS=... SECEXC=... cycles=...`). Cheap once the mechanism exists;
this is the "impossible on silicon without intrusive probes" capability.

## Validation strategy

**The authoritative oracle is the real nRF54L15 DK — not another emulator.**
Renode/QEMU are themselves models; validating csim against them only proves
csim agrees with *their* interpretation of ARMv8-M, and would propagate their
bugs. Silicon is the only thing that can settle a disagreement, and for the
Nordic **SPU** (chip-specific IDAU behaviour) it is the *only* authority.

Layered so the fast loop stays fast and the truth stays authoritative:

- **Inner loop — ARM ARM conformance suite (fast, automatable).** Directed
  tests from the architecture manual: attribution-table cases, SG-from-non-NSC
  fault, BLXNS frame layout, the EXC_RETURN matrix, integrity-signature
  validation. Pinned to the *spec*. (Phase 1's `test_trustzone_sau` is the
  first of these.) Where silicon later surprises us, the HW capture overrides
  the spec-derived expectation.
- **Authoritative oracle — nRF54L15 DK, via capture-and-replay.** Hardware is
  ground truth but low-bandwidth (you cannot cheaply diff internal state on
  silicon). So: run small directed firmware on the DK that exercises each
  primitive (SG, BXNS/BLXNS, secure exception, ±FP context, SPU attribution),
  capture ground truth **once** — architectural state via GDB/semihosting,
  per-transition cycle cost via DWT `CYCCNT` — and freeze those as **golden
  vectors**. csim regresses against real-silicon captures, for both function
  and timing. This is the paper's Testbed 1.
- **Renode = development aid only, never an authority.** It has independent
  (tlib/QEMU-lineage) TrustZone-M support — SAU/IDAU + NSC, secure exception
  exit (`ES/S/SPSEL/MODE/FType/DCRS`), secure interrupt targeting — which is
  useful for *seeing internal state while debugging* a divergence. But it does
  not decide correctness, and it is not cycle-accurate, so it never informs
  the cost model. If Renode and the DK disagree, the DK wins.
- **Firmware:** start with a hand-built minimal secure veneer (SG entries
  wrapping AES + key storage = P1/P2), not full TF-M. Maps directly to the
  partition schemes, and is the same image captured on the DK above.

## Confirmed execution steps (2026-07-26)

Ordered, individually-tested increments. Conformance firmware is the existing
Contiki-NG `examples/platform-specific/nrf/trustzone/` suite (nRF54L15-only),
built `BOARD=nrf54l15/dk` so one binary runs on csim and the DK.

- **[DONE]** Phase 0 — security state + banked register storage.
- **[DONE]** Phase 1 engine — `arm_security_attr()` SAU/IDAU attribution (+14 tests).
- **[DONE] Step 1** — memory-mapped SAU registers (`0xE000EDD0`), Secure-only RAZ/WI.
- **[DONE] Step 2** — hot-path enforcement + SecureFault recording (`arm_tz_blocks`).
- **[DONE] Step 3** — transition instructions: TT (3a) + SG/BXNS with SP-bank swap
  (3b). BLXNS + FNC_RETURN full form deferred (needs the exception stacking).
- **[DONE] Step 4 (core)** — secure exception entry/return: bank by security
  state, VTOR_S fetch, take the pending SecureFault, re-bank on return.
  Deferred: integrity signature, lazy FP, nested-secure, BLXNS.
- **[DONE] Step 5** — NVIC target-security (`NVIC_ITNS`) wired into exception
  entry. Deferred: banked priorities + banked SysTick.
- **[DONE] Step 6** — `has_trustzone=true` on `nrf54l15_config`; existing
  firmware runs byte-identically (Secure world, enforcement inert).
- **[DONE] Step 7** — per-node transition instrumentation (SG/BXNS/secure-exc).
- **[DONE] Step 8** — BLXNS + FNC_RETURN implemented; csim boots the **real**
  Contiki-NG `trustzone/` split image (`tz-boot` harness). The secure world
  initializes TrustZone, configures SAU/IDAU + the non-secure environment,
  routes IRQs (NVIC_ITNS), and hands off to Non-secure ("Non-secure world"
  banner); security state flips correctly, 9 world transitions (4 SG + 5 BXNS)
  counted. The arm-gcc 15.2 firmware build blocker was fixed upstream-style in
  `contiki-ng-nrf54l15` (`arch/cpu/arm/cortex-m/Makefile.cortex-m`: re-tag the
  attribute-less CMSE import lib; guarded `--no-warn-rwx-segments`).

**PLAN COMPLETE.** All emulator steps done and tested; the real split firmware
boots in csim. Remaining is the HW track (DK golden-vector capture — the
authoritative oracle) and deeper firmware exercise (radio/timer-driven rpl-udp,
secure services), both outside the core emulator.

## Step 9 (2026-09-03) — running the split image under the kernel

Steps 1–8 were verified with `tz-boot`, which drives one CPU with no
simulation kernel, no radio and no timers. Running the same images under the
kernel, as a config-driven test, exposed a set of gaps that a single-CPU
instruction budget cannot reach. All are now fixed:

- **Non-secure peripheral alias.** The Normal world addresses peripherals
  through the `0x4xxx_xxxx` window; the SoC registers them once at
  `0x5xxx_xxxx`. IO dispatch now folds the alias and records the transaction's
  security for the attribution work. Without it the Normal world's clock spun
  forever on an unmapped GRTC.
- **Non-secure view of the system registers.** `VTOR_NS` and the Non-secure
  NVIC alias at `0xE002E000` were unmapped, so the Secure world's hand-off
  configuration and its `SWI01` doorbell into the Normal world were silently
  dropped. The vector table base is now banked, the Non-secure view is
  filtered through `NVIC_ITNS`, and `SFSR`/`SFAR` are memory-mapped.
- **Banked special registers.** `MSR`/`MRS` of `MSP_NS`, `PSP_NS`,
  `PRIMASK_NS` and `CONTROL_NS` were ignored, so the Secure world's stack and
  control setup before `BLXNS` did nothing. The exception masks now bank on a
  world switch, with the active copy still in the hot-path field.
- **Interrupt capacity.** The NVIC held 240 lines; this SoC uses up to 265
  (`WDT30`), and lines at or above 256 were clamped to Secure and dropped.
- **Cross-domain exception nesting.** The background security state lived in a
  single flag, which a nested exception destroyed: an inner return restored
  the wrong state and the outer return then unstacked a Secure frame from the
  Non-secure stack. It now travels in `EXC_RETURN` as the architecture
  specifies, including the mode and exception-security bits.
- **Function return through a loaded PC.** A Non-secure callee returning to
  its Secure caller with `pop {…, pc}` was treated as an exception return.
  This crashed a node minutes into a run.
- **`VLSTM`/`VLLDM`** (the floating-point context save around a world switch)
  were undecoded.
- **Timer deadlines** were converted against a stale time mirror, running the
  Normal world's clock at roughly a third of real speed.

Also added, because the firmware now depends on them: **WDT30** with the
reset-reason register and a **system reset** that resets the NVIC, SysTick and
the SoC's peripherals in place while SRAM, the reset reason and the always-on
watchdog survive; the **DWT cycle counter** behind `DEMCR.TRCENA`; and an
**instruction-cache** stub.

**Verified against silicon.** A Seeed XIAO nRF54L15 runs the same two ELFs;
boot sequence, clock tick rate and the watchdog timeout and reset reason match
line for line. See `devices/nrf54l15-xiao/HARDWARE-COMPARISON.md`.

## Step 10 (2026-09-03) — attribution and permission enforcement

The attribution unit previously answered "non-secure" for every address, so
nothing was ever refused. Now:

- **Address attribution** takes a per-SoC hook alongside the SAU. On the
  nRF54L15 every peripheral answers at two addresses and the alias picks the
  security, so Non-secure code touching a Secure alias raises a SecureFault
  before the transaction reaches the bus. Memory is left to the SAU, which the
  secure world programs with the flash and RAM split and with the callable
  window holding the veneers. Feeding the memory protection controller's
  override regions into this decision was tried and reverted: it vetoes the
  SAU's callable window and breaks every gateway entry. That controller gates
  bus masters, including DMA, rather than the core's own attribution.

- **Peripheral permission.** All four security-unit instances are modelled:
  the 64 permission slots each governs, its violation event, address capture
  and interrupt. The permission registers reset to the values read from a
  Seeed XIAO nRF54L15 (`nrf54l_spu_perm_reset`): every present peripheral is
  Secure at reset except the VPR's four slots, and the slots whose mapping is
  fixed Secure (the instance itself, MPC00, KMU, CRACEN, WDT30, TAMPC and a
  few more) cannot be opened by any permission write. The MDK's generic reset
  value 0x8000002A (Non-secure) does not describe the part. Permission writes
  touch only the attribute, the DMA attribute where the slot has DMA, and the
  lock, which holds until reset. A Non-secure transaction reaching a Secure
  peripheral is terminated with an error: the core takes a precise BusFault
  (CFSR 0x8200, BFAR = the alias used, into the Secure world unless
  `AIRCR.BFHFNMINS`), the security unit latches the event with the first
  offender's low 16 address bits (cleared with the event) and pends its
  level-sensitive interrupt, and MPC00 latches MEMACCERR. The BusFault handler
  runs before the security unit's interrupt handler (equal priority, lower
  exception number), so what firmware reports on a violation is its BusFault
  handler's line. Split peripherals (GPIO, GPIOTE, DPPIC, PPIB, GRTC) attribute
  per pin or channel through the FEATURE registers; those are stored, not
  enforced, so a split slot is open to both worlds — on silicon a GPIOTE30
  channel that was never handed over does fault, which is why the hardware
  faults earlier than the emulator on the test below. All of this was measured
  with a probe firmware; the method and numbers are in
  `devices/nrf54l15-xiao/HARDWARE-COMPARISON.md`.
  `configs/test-tz-spu-violation-nrf54l15-xiao.yaml` drives a normal world
  built on the full platform instead of the minimal one and expects the
  secure world's BusFault report, which is also what the two images print on
  the XIAO.

- **Non-secure instruction fetch.** Execution from Secure memory is refused at
  the fetch, before the instruction runs, as an invalid entry point
  (SecureFault INVEP). From the callable window only `SG` may be fetched, so a
  Non-secure jump to anything but a gateway entry faults the same way. The
  attribution lookup is cached per window over which it cannot change — the
  4 KB page clamped to the SAU region boundaries around the program counter —
  so a page that holds both the callable window and Secure code is re-checked
  at each boundary and the ordinary path stays one compare per instruction.

- **TT** reports the Non-secure read and read-write attributes, which is what
  the secure world's pointer range checks are built from.

- The memory protection controller is modelled as register state so the
  firmware's configuration reads back.

Three existing unit tests ran Non-secure code from memory they never
attributed Non-secure, which the fetch check correctly refuses; their setup is
now realistic. Four tests were added for the fetch rule.

Still deferred: per-feature attribution of the split peripherals (GPIO pins,
GPIOTE and DPPI channels, GRTC compare channels and interrupt groups: stored,
not enforced); MPC00's MEMACCERR address registers; DMA-master attribution
through the memory protection controller. The bundled example's RAM-access-error probe cannot exercise it on
this chip — it points an `NRF_UARTE2_NS` instance that only the nRF5340 has —
and the emulator models no Non-secure DMA master on the nRF54L15 at all (the
console is Secure, the radio is driven by the Secure world), so there is
nothing to enforce against until one exists. Also deferred: the security
unit's clock sub-division (stored, not enforced), lazy floating-point state,
banked priorities and banked SysTick, and `AIRCR.PRIS`.

The radio's ramp-up and ramp-down are still instantaneous; the disabled-event
delay stands in for the ordering that gives, with a measured window
(`docs/design/nrf54l15-ack-gap.md`). Everything in the tree passes with it, so
giving the radio timed state is an improvement rather than a blocker.

## Verified result (re-measured 2026-07-30, branch `trustzone` @ `87c92b3`)

Branch is based on `main` @ `de7e41c` (the `v0.1.0` release commit) and contains
every commit on `main`.

**Test suites** — `arm-correctness` is **224 / 224**, of which **71 are
TrustZone** (`main` is 153, so the TZ work is +71):

| TZ test group | Tests |
|---|---|
| SAU/IDAU attribution | 14 |
| SAU memory-mapped registers | 9 |
| Data-access enforcement | 9 |
| TT / TTT / TTA / TTAT | 3 |
| SG / BXNS transitions | 11 |
| SecureFault exceptions | 6 |
| NVIC target-security (`NVIC_ITNS`) | 6 |
| Transition counters | 3 |
| BLXNS / FNC_RETURN | 10 |
| **Total** | **71** |

**No regression on the non-TZ path**, with `has_trustzone = true` live on the
same SoC the release regression-tests: `correctness` PASS, `radio-medium`
241/241, `cc1200-mock-host` 73/73, and `configs/test-2node-nrf54l15-dk.json`
**TEST PASSED** (60013 ms simulated — identical to `main`).

**Real split firmware boots** via the `tz-boot` harness. The secure world
initializes TrustZone, configures SAU/IDAU and the non-secure environment,
validates the NS image permissions and reset vector, routes IRQs
(`ITNS[7]=0x00000008`), and jumps to the non-secure reset handler:

| Split image | SG (NS→S) | BXNS (S→NS) | Total | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `trustzone/{secure,normal}-world` (`nrf54l15/dk`) | 389 | 390 | **779** | reaches Non-secure, banner + `sec ret` round-trip |
| `trustzone/rpl-udp` (`nrf54l15/xiao`) | 16 | 17 | **33** | reaches Non-secure, boots the RPL-UDP server |

Both end in `Non-secure` state with 0 secure exceptions, so the harness pass is
app-independent rather than tied to one image. (The earlier "9 transitions
(4 SG + 5 BXNS)" figure in Step 8 above was measured at that step, before the
`tzbench` workload ran on; it is kept as the step's historical record.)

Reproduce with:

```sh
TZ=~/work/contiki-ng-nrf54l15/examples/platform-specific/nrf/trustzone
./build/test_runner tz-boot \
    $TZ/secure-world/build/nrf/nrf54l15/dk/secure-world-example.nrf \
    $TZ/normal-world/build/nrf/nrf54l15/dk/normal-world-example.nrf
```

The split images are **not** in the csim tree — they are built from the
`contiki-ng-nrf54l15` checkout (branch `trustzone-port-v2`), so `tz-boot` is a
manual harness rather than part of the default gate.

Parallel HW track (non-blocking): DK capture toolchain (JLink/GDB + DWT `CYCCNT`
+ semihosting) on the current non-TZ nRF54L15 first, then per-primitive golden
vectors (SG/BXNS/secure-exc ±FP, **SPU attribution captured from silicon**) as
csim regression fixtures for Steps 3–5 + 7.

**Done when** csim boots `trustzone/rpl-udp` on `nrf54l15/dk`, counts transitions
network-wide, and per-primitive costs match DK golden vectors within HW spread.

## Staged plan + effort

| Phase | Work | Est. |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Security state + banked SP/CONTROL/limits; MSR/MRS_NS; refactor SP access | ~2–3 days |
| 1 | SAU + SPU-as-IDAU attribution in mem chokepoint; conformance vs `tz-target-cfg.c` | ~3–4 days |
| 2 | SG/BXNS/BLXNS/TT decode | ~2–3 days |
| 3 | Secure exception entry/return, integrity sig, lazy FP, SecureFault | ~4–5 days |
| 4 | NVIC target-security + banked priority + SysTick | ~2 days |
| 5 | Transition instrumentation + harness plumbing | ~1 day |
| — | ARM ARM conformance suite + **DK golden-vector capture/replay** (authoritative); Renode only as debug aid (spread across 1–4) | ~3–4 days |

Guard behind the existing `arm_config` capability so nRF52840 (M4, no TZ) and
the CC2538/MSP430 targets are unaffected.

## Open questions / risks

- **Phase 1 attribution correctness** and **Phase 3 stacking integrity** are
  the critical path: a plausible-but-wrong implementation silently diverges
  from silicon and quietly invalidates every transition-cost number the paper
  reports. Budget real validation there.
- **SPU coverage:** how much of the SPU region model does the Contiki-NG
  firmware actually program? Model that subset; don't chase the full SPU.
- **Determinism with banked SysTick + NS interrupts** — keep it fixed-seed
  reproducible (csim's core property).
- **FLPR interaction:** the nRF54L15 already has the RV32E FLPR in csim
  (`riscv-vpr-plan.md`); confirm SPU SECATTR changes here don't regress that.
